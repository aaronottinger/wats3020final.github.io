# The Book of Kells

### Introduction
For my final project, I have selected to focus on The Book of Kells, which “contains the four Gospels in Latin based on the Vulgate text which St Jerome completed in 384AD, intermixed with readings from the earlier Old Latin translation ("Book Of Kells - The Library Of Trinity College Dublin - Trinity College Dublin").” The Book of Kells is written on a prepared calfskin, called vellum and is heavily decorated with intricate drawings of plants, animals, and humans throughout its 340 folios contained inside. For my final, I will focus on the primary image from The Book of Matthew.

### Why This Image?
I selected this image because it is one of the most famous books in the world due to its decorations and it is one that I was able to see in person when I visited Ireland last year. I was captivated by the ornamentation on the pages I saw and the amount of detail that went into these decorations is unlike anything I’d ever seen before, especially given its age.
