## Welcome to My WATS3020 Final Page

# Intent
Here, I will be posting my work for my WATS3020 class to build out an overview of the history of text in tech. The site will contain a mixture of **text, imagery, visual, and audio content** that helps to tell the story of text in tech and how we use it today in comparison with how we used to.

## New Branch

Hi Matt, I'm adding this just so you can see what it's like to have someone work on your site, write it on a new branch in their fork, and ultimately, so you can receive a pull request, which you can then accept or reject. Pretty cool, huh? 

Don't worry, I won't be offended when you reject my pull request. ;)
