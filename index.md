# The Book of Kells

## Introduction
The purpose of this website is to present my final project for the WATS3020 class, demonstrating my understanding of the history of text in tech. Throughout this page, I will highlight what my selected imagery is, its significance and history, my own adaptation of the selected image, and an analysis of it. After that, I will then discuss the audience my adaptation is intended for and how I would look to persuade that audience with my adaptation. Lastly, I will outline my process and decision making around my adaptation, outlining how I arrived at conclusions that I have.

## Why This Image?
I selected this image because it is one of the most famous books in the world due to its decorations and it is one that I was able to see in person when I visited Ireland last year. I was captivated by the ornamentation on the pages I saw and the amount of detail that went into these decorations is unlike anything I’d ever seen before, especially given its age. 

## Historical Context
The Book of Kells, which “contains the four Gospels in Latin based on the Vulgate text which St Jerome completed in 384AD, intermixed with readings from the earlier Old Latin translation ("Book Of Kells - The Library Of Trinity College Dublin - Trinity College Dublin").” The Book of Kells is written on a prepared calfskin, called vellum and is heavily decorated with intricate drawings of plants, animals, and humans throughout its 340 folios contained inside. For my final, I will focus on the primary image from The Book of Matthew.
