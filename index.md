## Welcome to My WATS3020 Final Page

# Intent
Here, I will be posting my work for my WATS3020 class to build out an overview of the history of text in tech. The site will contain a mixture of **text, imagery, visual, and audio content** that helps to tell the story of text in tech and how we use it today in comparison with how we used to.
